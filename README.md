# CineplexShowtimes

CineplexShowtimes is a CLI that scrapes my local Cineplex theatre for movie showtimes as and goes into a chosen movies page to grab its synopsis.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cineplex_showtimes'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cineplex_showtimes

## Usage

To start the gem run

    $ bin\cineplex_showtimes

From there you will be met with a list of options. Choose the number beside a movie you wish to know more about
You can type 'list' to display the list of movies again
You can type 'exit' to quit the app

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
